Build fast and easy to use control software with Skui.

## User manual

### Controlling vs. Configuring vs. Programming
Normally these two words are near togehter, linguistically speaking. But in Skui they describe to fundamental differenct things.
When you *Control* Skui, you run it and change things by controlling *Panels*. Each *Panel* has *Visuals* where the controlling happens. A *Visual* could be a Nob or a Slider.
But also Graphs and Progess Bars are *Visuals*. Controling only works in *Run Mode*.

If you are in *Edit Mode* you can't *Control*, as said above. At the *Panel* you can now *Configure* *Visuals*. You can change size or move a *Visual*. 
By right clicking you can change properties of the *Visual*. This could be a range for a slider or the color of a button.
But you can not only *Configure* *Visuals*. You can *Configure* every *Node* using the *Node Editor*. 
You might want to change the Baud Rate *Property* of a Serial *Driver* or the location of a *Python Script*.
The *Configuration* is the initial state in that the program starts with. But what if I want change behaviour at runtime and implement logic?

*Programming* is the right thing to do. It happens in the *Node Editor* where you *Connect* different *Nodes* to each other.
By this you create *Logic Paths* from one *Node* to another. One of the easies exampeles for this is the connection between a Slider and a Progress Bar.
First you create two *Visual* *Nodes*. One Slider and One Progress Bar. By conecting the *Output* of the Slider *Node* and the *Input* of the Progress Bar *Node* you get a *Connection*.
Every time you *Control* or in more non Skui words change the Slider, so will the Progress Bar.

### Viewport
The *Viewport* is the main panel to control. It is not used for linking your Nodes. You can use the *Node Editor* for that.
The *Viewport* contains *Visuals* 

### Edit Mode
Edit mode is the mode to change your *Visuals*. You can configure them as you like.

You can select an *Viusal* by clicking on it. A bounding box pop's up. It is now possible to drag 
or resize the *Visual*.

If you want to select multible *Visuals* you can either press the mouse and drag or press shift 
and click on the *Visuals* you want to select.
